          <ol>
            <li>
              Every participant in the International Virtual Reality League
              ("IVRL" or "the league") is expected to behave with respect towards
              other players (not just league players), IVRL staff, officials,
              production team, and game developers. By joining IVRL you become a
              representative of the league and shall act accordingly. The
              following principles shall guide your behavior in game and also in
              Discord, Twitch, and other chats and media:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Helpfulness: IVRL serves the community. Helping each other
                  builds community bonds and fosters a welcoming environment for
                  new players.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Respect: Treating others with respect is fundamental. IVRL will
                  not tolerate toxic behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integrity: IVRL is committed to play fair play. These rules
                  provide the bare minimum. Players should hold themselves to a
                  standard of integrity above what these rules require.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              IVRL is against any toxic behavior. It is therefore expected that no
              IVRL members will engage in any hateful or harassing activities. A
              non-exhaustive list of prohibited behaviors includes:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Hate speech, offensive behavior, or verbal abuse related to sex,
                  gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race,
                  ethnicity, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or
                  religion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stalking or intimidation (physically or online).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spamming, raiding, hijacking, or inciting disruption of streams
                  or social media.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally
                  identifying information ("doxxing").
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes unwelcome sexualized
                  comments, jokes, and sexual advances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Any accusations of improper play or conduct shall be brought
              directly to a Referee or Strategic Director through the use of a
              ticket. Prohibited behaviors witnessed by an IVRL Official could
              result in punishment without being reported in a ticket.
            </li>
            <li>
              All players are presumed to have read these rules. Ignorance of
              these rules is not a defense. In some cases, Team Captains may be
              held responsible for the behavior of members of their team.
              Therefore, Team Captains should make every effort to ensure that
              their team members have read and understand these rules. Being a
              Team Captain is an important responsibility and should not be taken
              on lightly.

              Challenge matches must be accepted by the time of match generation for the next week, generally Monday at 12:00 ET.  IF the challenge is not accepted by that time, then the challenge request will be rejected.
              </li>

              The challenge match must be scheduled at the time it is requested.  Teams are allowed 7 days from the time the challenge is requested to schedule the match.

              The SRS gains from the cross-regional matches will be reduced to 1/3 that of a regional match with a reduced impact to lossed SRS to 1/4 that of a regional match.

              Due to game balance and/or the potential for some equipment to be
              exploited, the following equipment rules shall be followed:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>RPG</strong> - Permitted on "Large Maps" only.

                <li>
                  <strong>Shields</strong>
                  - Allowed, but due to a bug that makes
                  it possible for the player holding the shield to shoot through
                  parts of the shield, shield users may not shoot while either
                  holding the shield or using it for cover while it is standing.
                  In other words, a player must fully release the shield and it
                  must be either lying flat on the ground or holstered on the
                  player’s back before firing. Other players may, however, shoot
                  freely while following the shield user for protection.

                  IVRL is a community of passionate gamers who care about
                  competitive integrity. To protect this, the league require all
                  prospective IVRL players to disclose prior e-sports bans, VAC
                  bans or any relevant information concerning adverse findings
                  related to competitive video gaming against them in the past.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Aside from VAC bans, this information is not disclosed outside
                  of IVRL officials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occasionally, player applications reviewed by the IVRL officials
                  may need to be carefully considered if they indicate
                  pre-existing e-sports sanctions, hacking related bans or other
                  significant adverse findings.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Where IVRL Officials become aware of a player’s new or
                      previously undisclosed gaming sanction(s), they shall take
                      all reasonable steps to investigate and collect information
                      concerning the sanctions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      IVRL Officials will obtain a statement from the subject
                      player concerning the sanctions and explain any potential
                      impact on the player’s eligibility to participate in IVRL.

                    <li>
                      Where IVRL determines that the subject player’s continued
                      participation in IVRL may affect the broader IVRL community,
                      IVRL Officials shall escalate player applications to the
                      Player Advisory Committee ("PAC") for their consideration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Upon receipt of the Escalated Player Application ("EPA"),
                      the PAC shall deliberate on the evidence provided by IVRL
                      and the subject player’s statement.

                  Any player who discloses or is found to have any VAC ban newer
                  than 500 days old will not be allowed to participate in IVRL.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      These players will be allowed to participate once the ban
                      has aged past 500 days (see Rule 9.2.9 for restrictions).

                  Any player who discloses or is found to have VAC bans older than
                  500 days but less than 1,800 days shall be under mandatory
                  High-Level Stream Order.

                    <li>
                      This stream order has higher requirements on what shall be
                      recorded and requires that all recorded matches are
                      submitted (rather than submission upon request).

                  All VAC bans a player has accrued are to be disclosed on
                  registration. Failure to disclose any VAC ban may result in
                  additional restrictions. For avoidance of doubt, this includes
                  any ban older than 1,800 days as well as any bans on alternate
                  accounts.

                      days old at any point when registered will result in the
                      counter being reset to zero (500 day ban)

                      and 1,800 days old at any point when registered will result
                      in penalty points

                    <li>
                      Failure to disclose a VAC ban older than 1,800 days will

                </li>
                <li>
                  Players must disclose if they receive a VAC ban after
                  registering for IVRL within 48 hours of receiving the ban, or
                  before any match play, whichever is sooner.
