    rules:
      - text: |
          Every participant in the International Virtual Reality League
          ("IVRL" or "the league") is expected to behave with respect towards
          other players (not just league players), IVRL staff, officials,
          production team, and game developers. By joining IVRL you become a
          representative of the league and shall act accordingly. The
          following principles shall guide your behavior in game and also in
          Discord, Twitch, and other chats and media:
        ulwrap: true
        rules:
          - text: |
              Helpfulness: IVRL serves the community. Helping each other
              builds community bonds and fosters a welcoming environment for
              new players.
          - text: |
              Respect: Treating others with respect is fundamental. IVRL will
              not tolerate toxic behavior.
          - text: |
              Integrity: IVRL is committed to play fair play. These rules
              provide the bare minimum. Players should hold themselves to a
              standard of integrity above what these rules require.
      - text: |
          IVRL is against any toxic behavior. It is therefore expected that no
          IVRL members will engage in any hateful or harassing activities. A
          non-exhaustive list of prohibited behaviors includes:

              Hate speech, offensive behavior, or verbal abuse related to sex,
              gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race,
              ethnicity, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or
              eligion.
          - text: |
              Stalking or intimidation (physically or online).
          - text: |
              Spamming, raiding, hijacking, or inciting disruption of streams
              or social media.
          - text: |
              Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally
              identifying information ("doxxing").
          - text: |
              Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes unwelcome sexualized
              comments, jokes, and sexual advances.
          - text: |
              Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
      - text: |
          Any accusations of improper play or conduct shall be brought
          directly to a Referee or Strategic Director through the use of a
          ticket. Prohibited behaviors witnessed by an IVRL Official could
          result in punishment without being reported in a ticket.
      - text: |
          All players are presumed to have read these rules. Ignorance of
          these rules is not a defense. In some cases, Team Captains may be
          held responsible for the behavior of members of their team.
          Therefore, Team Captains should make every effort to ensure that
          their team members have read and understand these rules. Being a
          Team Captain is an important responsibility and should not be taken
          on lightly.
