    rules:
      - text: |
          Every participant in the International Virtual Reality League
          ("IVRL" or "the league") is expected to behave with respect towards
          other players (not just league players), IVRL staff, officials,
          production team, and game developers. By joining IVRL you become a
          representative of the league and shall act accordingly. The
          following principles shall guide your behavior in game and also in
          Discord, Twitch, and other chats and media:
        ulwrap: true
        rules:
          - text: |
              Helpfulness: IVRL serves the community. Helping each other
              builds community bonds and fosters a welcoming environment for
              new players.
          - text: |
              Respect: Treating others with respect is fundamental. IVRL will
              not tolerate toxic behavior.
          - text: |
              Integrity: IVRL is committed to play fair play. These rules
              provide the bare minimum. Players should hold themselves to a
              standard of integrity above what these rules require.
      - text: |
          IVRL is against any toxic behavior. It is therefore expected that no
          IVRL members will engage in any hateful or harassing activities. A
          non-exhaustive list of prohibited behaviors includes:

              Hate speech, offensive behavior, or verbal abuse related to sex,
              gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race,
              ethnicity, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or
              eligion.
          - text: |
              Stalking or intimidation (physically or online).
          - text: |
              Spamming, raiding, hijacking, or inciting disruption of streams
              or social media.
          - text: |
              Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally
              identifying information ("doxxing").
          - text: |
              Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes unwelcome sexualized
              comments, jokes, and sexual advances.
          - text: |
              Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
      - text: |
          Any accusations of improper play or conduct shall be brought
          directly to a Referee or Strategic Director through the use of a
          ticket. Prohibited behaviors witnessed by an IVRL Official could
          result in punishment without being reported in a ticket.
      - text: |
          All players are presumed to have read these rules. Ignorance of
          these rules is not a defense. In some cases, Team Captains may be
          held responsible for the behavior of members of their team.
          Therefore, Team Captains should make every effort to ensure that
          their team members have read and understand these rules. Being a
          Team Captain is an important responsibility and should not be taken
          on lightly.

            During the first two sets, teams are awarded 3 challenges that can be used outside of their standard region. This will allow cross-regional

            formula will be utilized for the match, but the SRS gain to the winning team will be divided by 3 and the SRS of the losing team will be 
            divided by 4. Over the course of the 3 cross-regional challenges, a team can gain up to one standard match SRS or lose up to 3/4 of one 
            standard match SRS. The offset in risk is an incentive to challenge across regions.

          rules:
            - text: | 
                Player penalty points are applied to each individual player based on infractions listed below. These points transfer with the player between \
                teams and will follow the expiration period outlined in this section.
            - text: |
                Team points are applied to the team and not the individual players on the team. These points will follow the expiration period outlined in this 
                section.
            - text: |
                Penalty points expire after an assigned period of time. All expiration periods are based upon the latest infraction date. The tables below are 
                guidance, but IVRL Officials may assess penalties on a case-by-case basis.

          title:  Discord and Code of Conduct Penalties
          rules:
            - text: |
                Any spamming, trolling, doxxing, defamation, sexually explicit behavior, public accusations, or other violations of the Code of Conduct by an 
                IVRL player in any forum is penalized as follows:
              rules:
                - text: "First offense: written warning."
                - text: "Second offense: second written warning, 1 penalty point, and a 24-hour Discord comment ban."
                - text: "Third offense: third written warning, 2 penalty points, and a 1-week Discord comment ban."
                - text: "Fourth and further offenses: 3 penalty points, and permanent mute in Discord."
            - text: |
                Though penalty points expire, warnings do not. Thus, a player who receives a third warning after the penalty points have expired from her second 
                warning, will still receive 3 penalty points and a perma-mute at that third warning.
            - text: |
                Attempting to evade these penalties through alternate accounts, or other means, invites further penalties, including complete bans from IVRL 
                participation, at the discretion of IVRL Officials.

                Players are required to record their POV during IVRL-sanctioned matches in accordance with Section 4. Failures to record are 
                penalized as follows:
              rules:
                - text: 1 penalty point for First infraction
                - text: 3 penalty points for second infraction

          rules:
            - text: |
                Player punishments will be applied based only on penalty points accrued by individual players. Team points are not relevant.
              rules:
                - text: "After obtaining 7 penalty points: 1 week suspension"

            - text: |
                Suspensions/bans equal to or greater than 2 weeks will be accompanied by a discord mute for the duration of the penalty. Mute duration may be lessened 
                by the officials at their discretion.

          title:  Team Sanctions
          rules:
            - text: |
                Team sanctions will be applied based on the team's total penalty points, meaning the total points assigned to the team plus any points assigned to the 
                team’s rostered members. If a team removes a player whose points contributed to a team sanction, the team’s total penalty points may be reduced but the 
                sanction will not.
              rules:
                - text: "After obtaining 14 penalty points: 1 week suspension"

                Expiration periods for both team and player penalty points run from the date of the latest infraction. For example, a player with 2 points who 
                earns a third point will hold all 3 points for 3 months from the date of her last infraction.

                        If a player is removed from a team, any infractions of a player that occurred while they were rostered will be assessed as part of the team 
                        total for those infractions. After the Team total has been reviewed and any penalties applied, the points will be removed for future violations 
                        due to the player leaving.

                        suspended weeks. Also, if a match is postponed from a week a player had an active suspension, they are not eligible to play in that match.

                        disbands. Following disbandment, no more than 2 of the members may join a different team at the same time. In addition, no single player 
                        may hold a captain or co-captain role. These restrictions will be removed after the original time of the forced inactivity is served.
